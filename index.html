	  <p style="float:left; margin-right: 20px; text-align:justify">I received B.E. and M.E. degrees in electrical engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2008 and 2012, respectively, and Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2014. I am currently an associate professor with the School of Intelligent Systems Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, China, and an active member in the Center for <a href="https://sysuwireless.github.io/index.html">Wireless Intelligent Networks and Systems (WINETS)</a>. Before joining Sun Yat-sen University, I have been an Associate Researcher/Professor with the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I have been the Guest Lead Editor for a special issue in IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing. I was given the MAC and Cross-layer BEST PAPER AWARD in IEEE WCNC 2019.</p>

	  <p style="float:left; margin-right: 20px; text-align:justify"> I have a broad interest in optimization and machine learning appraoches for wireless systems and intelligent networking, especially for self-sustainable Internet of Things. The machine learning approaches are motivated by the increasing complexity of the future wireless networks due to close couplings among a huge number of wireless entities with heterogeneities in service and resource requirements. By continuously interacting with the environment, a model-free learning based approach, e.g., deep reinforcement learning, provides the mechanism for network entities to build knowledge about the environment and make autonomous decisions to maximize the network performance. Another ressearch focus is to develop batterly-less IoT networks by combining wireless power transfer and low power communication technology, e.g., ambient wireless backscatter.
